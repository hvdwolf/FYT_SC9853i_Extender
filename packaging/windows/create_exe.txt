# Download launch4j from http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/
launch4j is old and still needs java-8

copy the full FYT_SC9853i_Extender.jar into this folder
copy the windows version 11 jre into this folder. Make sure it is unzipped and that the folder is simply named jre.

1) Run launch4j as "launch4j fse-jre.xml" to create an exe and have it linked to the jre. 
NOTE: zip the exe, the LICENSE and the jre folder into your distribution zip.

Run launch4j as "launch4j fse.xml" to create an exe that simply uses the system wide jre 
on the windows machine it is run on. That machine has to has the Version 11 jre/jdk or newer.
